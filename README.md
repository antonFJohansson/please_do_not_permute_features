# please_do_not_permute_features

This repo contains the code for my implementation and ideas surrounding the article "Please Stop Permuting Features: An Explanation and Alternatives" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03151).

I investigate the variable importance measures under a Gaussian process model where we have access to the uncertainty in the estimates as well. This could then enable researchers to see where we are extrapolating and where we can trust our importance measures.

To see a showcase of the method, see showcase.py.
